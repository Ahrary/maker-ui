# Layout Components

At its core, Gatsby Theme Elements is a layout engine that lets you build responsive sites in minutes. You can use the layout component library to construct unique responsive page designs.

All components are configured with default values that you set in `options.js` and `theme.js`. This means your layout templates will look very clean and require little additional styling.

If your site requires multiple layouts (perhaps a sidebar and a full-width template), you can override the default settings at the component level with props.
