# Getting Started

To install Elements, first download the theme:

```sh
npm i --save gatsby-theme-elements
```

or

```sh
yarn add gatsby-theme-elements
```

In your `gatsby-config.js` file, add:

```sh
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['gatsby-theme-elements'],
}
```

## File Shadowing

Elements creates your default layout settings by shadowing two configuration files. Create a new folder in your project's `/src` directory called `gatsby-theme-elements` and add these two files:

- `theme.js`
- `options.js`

Unlike other Gatsby themes, you will rarely need to shadow Elements theme components. Instead, you can use these configuration files to handle your layout's default behavior.
