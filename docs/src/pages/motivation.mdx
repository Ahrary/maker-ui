# Motivation

The primary goal behind Elements is to help theme authors create responsive, accessible Gatsby sites in as little as 5 minutes.

While this theme can be used on its own, it is intended for use as a parent or sibling theme. It makes no attempt to format or generate data - it is merely the skeleton for your own creations.

## The Ecosystem

I come from a background as a WordPress theme developer, and after many years of design for clients, I noticed that 90% of the websites I build have the same key elements.

WordPress themes like [Genesis by StudioPress](https://www.studiopress.com/features/) leverage these common web conventions and allow developers to create incredibly flexible child themes. In my opinion, Gatsby's nascent theme ecosystem can benefit from flexible theming like this.

Gatsby's strength is in its data mesh, speed, integrations, and build process. My goal for Elements is to eliminate the administrative parts of web design (content layouts, responsive navigation, accessibility, theming, etc.) so authors can spend more time focusing on creating content or manipulating interesting data.

If Elements can help you manifest your static site ideas and try out the JAMstack, then my mission is accomplished!
